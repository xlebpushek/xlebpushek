### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

To begin with, I am a student studying to be a programmer. Since they can't teach anything sensible in college, you have to crawl along the tops of IT yourself.
I study a wide variety of languages, from bash to c-like, which is pretty great for me.
Programming for me is a hobby, which is very important for a developer, otherwise a good project will hardly work.

At the moment I am working on a number of projects, take at least the system configuration [dotfiles](https://github.com/xlebpushek/dotfiles), [dotdrops](https://github.com/xlebpushek/dotdrops) or gulp configuration for simplified writing of your own and other sites.
I would like something more, for example, collaborations with some companies like apple or google, I think I have something to help them (given my incredibly fast learning curve).

It is likely that there are not many repositories in my profile at the moment, but this is due to the fact that most are stored locally. I don't really like to expose projects before they reach release.
